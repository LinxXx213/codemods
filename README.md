# Codemods

This repository contains codemods I have used to modify my codebases. They are intended for usage with 
[jscodeshift](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jscodeshift). See the docs there for steps to make use of the transforms.

## TypeORM
These codemods were used to migrate from TypeORM 0.2.x to 0.3.x. [This blog post](https://dev.clintonblackburn.com/2023/07/15/upgrading-typeorm-with-jscodeshift.html)
explains my motivations for writing these.
